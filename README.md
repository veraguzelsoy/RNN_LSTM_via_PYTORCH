# RNN LSTM with PYTORCH


Pytorch is a Python based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of audiences:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
- Deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed


pros:
- Interactively debugging PyTorch.
- Many users who have used both frameworks would argue that makes pytorch significantly easier to debug and visualize.
- Clean support for dynamic graphs
- Organizational backing from Facebook
- Blend of high level and low level APIs


cons:
- Much less mature than alternatives
- Limited references / resources outside of the official documentation


# Here, we have 3 notebook for PyTorch which can be use as template coding
-Basic
-RNN
-LSTM
